# tiles-to-tiff
Python script for converting XYZ raster tiles for slippy maps to a georeferenced TIFF image. From [https://github.com/jimutt/tiles-to-tiff](https://github.com/jimutt/tiles-to-tiff).

## Requirement:

- install GDAL.
- Add [Mapbox's token](https://account.mapbox.com/), create PATH named `Mapbox_token` and input your token.

## Usage:

```
python tiles_to_tiff.py
```

## Update:

Fix it as a function, and try to transplant it to our QGIS plugin [buildseg v0.3](https://github.com/deepbands/buildseg).
